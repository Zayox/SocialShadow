## !! VPN to disable cookie pop up 

I've made the scripts on US insta facebook ... so we have either to use a vpn to make the scripts work (slower) or 
change the script to make it work in french


To do: 

Next steps ---> add more scripts,
                checkboxes to select clear settings (check if the password is the same for every website), 
                Bastien video form, 
                Firebase Registration (forgot password and stuff...), 
                Profile customisation (pfp ... and idk)
